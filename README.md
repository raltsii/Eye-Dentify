# Eye-Dentify
A silly Pokemon gameshow, coming SOON to a web browser near you.

## What is Eye-Dentify?
You're shown a Pokemon's eye--nothing else, and have to guess what 'mon it is. Sounds simple enough, right? But without any context clues, they can get tricky fast....
Features three modes! Pokeball, Ultra Ball and Quick Ball.

### Pokeball
The "main" game mode. You're shown an eye and you guess it. Points are awarded based on difficulty and number of guesses.

### Ultra Ball
Two VERY similar eyes are displayed. You have to guess which Pokemon are on screen, and in what position. Over the course of 4 guesses, you'll be given hints. First, something that connects the two Pokemon. Are they both grass types? Second, one of the Pokemon (but not its position) will be revealed at random. Finally, you'll have both Pokemon revealed, but will have to win a 50/50 for guessing which one goes where. Over the course of your guesses, the game will inform you if one of the Pokemon you've guessed is correct (but not if the location is...). Points scale from 4-1 based on number of guesses.

### Quick Ball
One relatively easy eye will be displayed. Once shown, a timer will start. Buzz in and place your guess! But be warned--if you take to long to lock in the Pokemon after buzzing in, you wont get any points. Points are awarded based on how fast the user buzzes in.

## What plans do you have for the future?
A lot! Multiplayer, leaderboards, and user uploaded modes are our three main stretch goals. For now, though, we want to get the site up and running with it's base features.
